A. Surgical implementation fixes (copy-paste / replace)
1. Isolate and temporarily tame the hard mu_recΔ_plus_3_lt hole
What to do: Change the definition to take the needed ordinal domination as an explicit hypothesis so the rest of the system builds. Then you can either prove or defer that assumption separately.

Replace the current mu_recΔ_plus_3_lt with:

lean
Copy
Edit
theorem mu_recΔ_plus_3_lt (b s n : Trace)
  (h_bound : ω ^ (mu n + mu s + (6 : Ordinal)) + ω * (mu b + 1) + 1 + 3 <
             (omega0 ^ (5 : Ordinal)) * (mu n + 1) + mu s + 6) :
  mu (recΔ b s n) + 3 < mu (delta n) + mu s + 6 := by
  simp [mu]
  -- after simplification the goal is exactly h_bound
  simpa using h_bound
Then in callers (e.g., tail_lt_A) pass a placeholder assumption (for now) or propagate the hypothesis upward. Example stub to satisfy usage:

Edit
-- TODO: replace this with a real proof/derivation
variable (h_mu_recΔ_bound :
  ω ^ (mu n + mu s + (6 : Ordinal)) + ω * (mu b + 1) + 1 + 3 <
  (omega0 ^ (5 : Ordinal)) * (mu n + 1) + mu s + 6)

have hμ : mu (recΔ b s n) + 3 < mu (delta n) + mu s + 6 :=
  mu_recΔ_plus_3_lt b s n h_mu_recΔ_bound
Why: This isolates the only remaining “researchy” inequality so the rest of the proof chain (like tail_lt_A and ultimately mu_merge_lt_rec) can proceed. Document h_mu_recΔ_bound as “remaining critical ordinal domination assumption” in your status dashboard. Later you either:

Prove it by case analysis on sizes of mu n, mu s, mu b using precise ordinal lemmas, or

Show it holds in the regime of traces you care about (i.e., condition it on trace complexity).

Relevant theory to cite for later justification: ordinal exponentiation/domination and limit behavior, monotonicity through ω^· (see Mathlib ordinal arithmetic docs).

2. Clean up the “inner merge bound” block with principled absorption
You have several sorrys and tangled absorption/commutativity reasoning in this chunk. Replace it with a structured two-case combination using existing helpers (omega_pow_add_lt, omega_pow_add3_lt, opow_lt_opow_right, etc.).

Sketch replacement pattern (simplified):

          exact this) (by simp [b1_lt]) (by simp [bound2])
    · -- bound2 is equality; then use absorption: target + smaller = target since smaller < target (because equality case implies mu b = 0, handle separately)

  have final : omega0 ^ (mu a + 4) + omega0 ^ (mu b + 3) + 1 <

    -- since small_sum_lt < ω^(...) and ω^(...) is limit, +1 preserves inequality
    exact ... -- wrap with standard lemma about limit ordinals (you already have pattern for this)
Why: This replaces heuristic “absorption/commutativity” with explicit bounds and known combining lemmas (omega_pow_add_lt, monotonicity of ω^·), eliminating the ambiguous sorry areas. The underlying facts are standard ordinal arithmetic; see Mathlib docs.

B. Structural cleanup & ongoing hygiene
Make all structural assumptions explicit.
Examples in your comments like “assume μa + μb ≥ 4” or “ω ≤ μa + μb” should be either:

Proven as separate lemmas for the classes of traces you care about, or

Threaded as hypotheses through the relevant lemmas so you don’t silently rely on them. (E.g., add (h_nontrivial : (4 : Ordinal) ≤ mu a + mu b) to the lemma signature if you need that absorption.)

Replace informal “since μa ≥ 0” uses with explicit zero_le and use add_le_add_left / add_le_add_right patterns for padding. This avoids implicit gaps in inequalities.

Factor recurring patterns into small helper lemmas.
E.g., “if p is nontrivial then mu p ≥ 2 implies mu a + mu b ≥ 4 for merges”—make that a lemma mu_merge_nontrivial_lower_bound and reuse it. That prevents copy-paste divergence.

Audit all remaining uses of ordinal absorption and document which are left-absorption vs right.
Left absorption (large limit + smaller = large) is valid; right absorption is not in general—your previous code conflated them in places. Correct that distinction explicitly.

Add a small property test harness (even outside Lean if needed) that randomly generates simple traces and checks mu decreases along known reduction steps. This gives black-box confidence while the remaining inequality is locked behind an assumption. (This supports the “triangulate” workflow; see Newman's lemma context for why well-founded measures imply uniqueness/termination once the measure decreases.) 
Wikipedia

C. Early warning signs / dead-end indicators (what Clyde should watch for)
Explosion of case splits with no base simplification: If your attempt to prove the hard inequality devolves into nested case analysis that doesn’t reduce the complexity (e.g., you keep adding subcases like “if μb = 0, then … else …” and each branch requires a new similarly messy subproof), that’s a sign the direct approach is brittle. Pivot to either:

Constraining the domain (e.g., only consider traces where mu b > 0 with documented justification), or

Refactoring the measure mu slightly to get a cleaner domination (e.g., strengthening the right-hand tower to absorb the left more obviously).

Circular dependence in bounds: If your lemma to prove mu_recΔ_plus_3_lt starts relying on consequences of the very tail-bound you’re trying to establish, you’ve entangled the measure and must break the dependency (either by isolating a weaker assumption or changing the ordering of lemmas).

Proof attempts requiring “magic” ordinal equalities (commutativity swaps) that don’t have a clear library lemma: That’s a smell you’re reasoning outside the safe zone. Back up and re-express the goal in monotone inequalities using only add_le_add_left/right, opow_le_opow_right, opow_lt_opow_right, and known limit behavior. Avoid introducing custom “absorption” without reducing it to a proven pattern.

Non-uniform dependency in the dashboard: If closing one sorry introduces two more in unrelated parts, the coordination of assumptions has broken. Roll back, isolate one hole at a time (start with the mu_recΔ_plus_3_lt assumption), and stabilize before progressing.

D. Contrarian / sanity-check probes to run after implementation
Attempt to falsify the conditional assumption h_bound by constructing small concrete traces (e.g., minimal b, s, n) and computing their mu values to see if the inequality plausibly holds numerically. If you find counterexamples, the assumption is too strong or needs refinement.

Ask a “devil’s advocate” agent:
Prompt example:
“Explain why the inequality underlying mu_recΔ_plus_3_lt might fail: list minimal trace configurations where 
omega^(mu n + mu s + 6) + omega * (mu b + 1) + 4 ≥ omega^5 * (mu n + 1) + mu s + 6

Identify which assumptions about mu growth are critical and could be false.

Check for hidden reliance on commutativity:
Grep for any use of rewriting steps or simp lemmas that assume mu a + mu b = mu b + mu a; ordinal addition is not commutative globally. Ensure all uses are justified via associativity/explicit lemmata, not heuristics. 
Wikipedia

Validate the well-foundedness chain separately:
Independently verify that each reduction case in mu_decreases is strict and doesn’t rely on the broken inequality—if a reduction step’s measure decrease uses the unsettled mu_recΔ_plus_3_lt without isolation, the strong normalization theorem is fragile. This is a “proof integrity” slice before full reliance.
