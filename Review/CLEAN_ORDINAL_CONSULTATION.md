# ORDINAL ARITHMETIC CONSULTATION REQUEST

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

We are implementing a strong normalization proof for an axiom-free formal foundation using ordinal μ-measures. We need to prove that a specific step rule decreases the measure, which reduces to proving this ordinal inequality:

```
ω^4 * (ω^3 + ω^2 + 2) + 1 < ω^9 + 1
```

## CURRENT LEAN 4 CODE

```lean
theorem mu_lt_eq_diff_both_void :
  MetaSN.mu (integrate (merge .void .void)) < MetaSN.mu (eqW .void .void) := by
  simp only [MetaSN.mu]
  show omega0 ^ (4 : Ordinal) * (omega0 ^ (3 : Ordinal) + omega0 ^ (2 : Ordinal) + 2) + 1 <
       omega0 ^ (9 : Ordinal) + 1
  
  -- This is where we're stuck
  _
```

## CONTEXT

- **Axiom-free requirement**: No `sorry`, `axiom`, or `admit` allowed in final code
- **Lean 4 + Mathlib**: Standard ordinal arithmetic modules imported
- **Part of larger system**: This is one step in a strong normalization proof for procedural truth semantics

## CURRENT IMPORTS
```lean
import Mathlib.SetTheory.Ordinal.Basic
import Mathlib.SetTheory.Ordinal.Arithmetic  
import Mathlib.SetTheory.Ordinal.Exponential
import Mathlib.Algebra.Order.SuccPred
```

## REQUEST

We're looking for any approach that works. Whether that's specific Lean 4 code, alternative mathematical strategies, different μ-measure designs, or completely different ideas we haven't considered.

What would you recommend?
