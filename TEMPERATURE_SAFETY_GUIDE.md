# Temperature Safety Guide - Multi-Model Configuration

## What Models Are Affected (and Which Are NOT)

### ✅ AFFECTED: OpenAI Models Only
The workspace settings **ONLY** target OpenAI models specifically:
- `o3` / `o3-mini` (requires temperature=1)
- `gpt-4o` 
- `o1-preview` / `o1-mini`

### ❌ NOT AFFECTED: All Other Models
These models use completely separate configuration paths and are **untouched**:
- **Anthropic Claude** (claude-3-5-sonnet, etc.) → Uses Continue config or VS Code Anthropic extension
- **Google Gemini** → Separate provider
- **Ollama/Local models** → Separate provider  
- **Any other non-OpenAI models** → Separate providers

## How It Works

### Workspace Settings (Current Implementation)
```json
"github.copilot.chat.advanced": {
    // Only target OpenAI models specifically - leaves others untouched
    "openai/gpt-4o": { "temperature": 1 },
    "openai/o3": { "temperature": 1 },
    // ... other OpenAI models
}
```

### Continue Configuration (Separate)
Your Continue config at `~/.continue/config.json` handles other models:
```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "title": "Claude-3.5-Sonnet", 
      "provider": "anthropic",  // ← Completely separate from Copilot
      "temperature": 1          // ← Managed independently
    }
  ]
}
```

## Why This Is Safe

1. **Provider Isolation**: GitHub Copilot settings only affect GitHub Copilot's OpenAI integration
2. **Explicit Targeting**: We specify exact model names rather than wildcards
3. **Separate Config Paths**: Continue, Anthropic extension, etc. use different settings files
4. **No Cross-Contamination**: Temperature settings are provider-scoped

## Testing Verification

After implementing these settings:
1. **O3 models**: Should work (no more temperature=0.1 errors)
2. **Claude models**: Should work exactly as before
3. **Other models**: Completely unaffected

## Emergency Rollback

If anything breaks, simply remove the `github.copilot.chat.advanced` section from `.vscode/settings.json`.
