● Perfect! I can see the exact errors. There are still
several universe level inference failures on lines
964, 967, 968, 1091, 1101, 1108, and 1126. Let me
also see what's happening with the incomplete calc
statement around line 994:
● Read(OperatorKernelO6\Meta\Termination.lean)
⎿  Read 20 lines (ctrl+r to expand)
● I can see the issue now. There are two main problems:
1. Universe level inference failures - multiple locations where the type inference is failing
2. Incomplete calc statement - the code has several
   
    sorry statements and incomplete proofs around the commutativity issues
Let me use the TodoWrite tool to plan the systematic
fixes needed:
● Update Todos
⎿ ☐ Fix universe level inference errors on lines
964, 967, 968 using proven patterns
☐ Fix universe level inference errors on lines
1091, 1101, 1108, 1126 using same proven
patterns
☐ Clean up incomplete calc statement and ordinal
commutativity issues around lines 994-1010
● Now let me systematically fix the universe level
inference errors. Based on the comprehensive error
handling guide in the handover file, I need to apply
the proven patterns. Let me start with the first
batch around lines 964-968:

975              apply opow_lt_opow_right
● Good, that fixed the first set of universe level
errors. Now let me fix the other locations using the
same proven pattern. Let me check what's happening
around lines 1091, 1101, 1108, and 1126:
● Read(OperatorKernelO6\Meta\Termination.lean)

● I can see the pattern now. There are multiple places
where the universe level inference is failing with
very similar patterns. Let me systematically fix them
using the proven solution. Let me fix line 1094
first:
