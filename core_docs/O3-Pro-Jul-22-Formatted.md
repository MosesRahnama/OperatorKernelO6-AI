# O3-Pro-Jul-22

## Recommended Route: O-6 (Six Operators)

If Complement-Uniqueness (CU) fails after exhaustive confluence proof, fall back to O-5R and drop Priority-2.

---

## Full Syntax (O-6 + Discretionary Macros)

### Core Trace:
- `void` — neutral true
- `delta Trace` — unary successor / dual
- `integrate Trace` — potential negation half
- `merge Trace Trace` — commutation-free juxtaposition
- `recΔ Trace Trace Trace` — primitive recursion on δ-chains
- `eqW Trace Trace` — equality witness

### Macros (not kernel; erased before final check):
- `var Trace` — de-Bruijn index as δ-chain
- `lam Trace`
- `app Trace Trace`
- `tag Label`
- `pair Trace Trace`

### Variable Encoding:
- `var 0 := void`
- `var (n+1) := delta (var n)`

### Substitution:
```lean
subst (u : Trace) : Trace → Trace  (pure Trace program)
subst u (var 0)       = u
subst u (var (n+1))   = delta (var n)             -- shift-down
subst u (delta t)     = delta (subst u t)
subst u (integrate t) = integrate (subst u t)
subst u (merge a b)   = merge (subst u a) (subst u b)
subst u (recΔ b s t)  = recΔ (subst u b) (subst u s) (subst u t)
subst u (eqW a b)     = eqW (subst u a) (subst u b)
```

### Rewrites (added to existing four):
- `Rrec₀ : recΔ b s void → b`
- `Rrec₁ : recΔ b s (delta n) → s (recΔ b s n)`
- `Req₁ : eqW a a → void` (implicit nf-test)
- `Req₂ : eqW a b (a≠b canonical) → integrate(merge a b)`

### Canonical Ordering:
Serialize terms; smallest first ⇒ confluence.

## Proof Roadmap (Lean Filenames in Brackets)

### Stage A – Calculus Hygiene
1. **strong_norm.lean**  
   Multiset(β, ann, δ-height, eqW-flag) → SN for O-6.
2. **confluence.lean**  
   Critical-pair enumeration; join 8 new peaks.
3. **nf_unique.lean**  
   SN+CR ⇒ unique normal form. (feeds CU)

### Stage B – Negation / Boolean Layer
1. **complement_unique.lean**  
   Prove Theorem 3.1 CU via A2+A3.
2. **involution.lean**  
   Theorem 3.2 ((¬¬t)=t).
3. **connective_laws.lean**  
   Derive De Morgan, distributivity using CU.

### Stage C – Arithmetic
1. **rec_add.lean**  
   `add(m,n) := recΔ n (λk. delta k) m`; prove spec.
2. **rec_mul.lean**  
   Mult via nested recΔ; spec proof.
3. **eqNat.lean**  
   Sound+complete w.r.t δ-length; uses eqW.

### Stage D – Proof Theory
1. **proof_checker.lean**  
   Inductive derivation codes; Proof predicate; soundness.
2. **proof_encoder.lean**  
   Completeness: derivation ⇒ Trace proof.
3. **prov_sigma1.lean**  
   `Prov(c) := ∃k<δᵏ bound, Proof(k,c)=void` (encoded by recΔ Search).

### Stage E – Diagonal & Gödel
1. **quote.lean**  
   Meta compiler code `t ↦ Trace`; Lean-proved injective.
2. **subF.lean**  
   Substitution predicate inside Trace; capture-free lemma.
3. **diagonal.lean**  
   `ψ s.t. nf(merge (F ⌜ψ⌝) ψ)=void` using eqW plateau.
4. **godel1.lean**  
   `Cons ⇒ ¬Prov(G)`; based on D1–D3, E3.
5. **godel2.lean**  
   D-conditions internalised; Cons unprovable.

### Stage F – Axiom-Freedom Audit
1. **static_scan.lean**  
   Rat-tail script confirming Lean file imports = 0 axioms.
2. **extraction.lean**  
   Optional: erase macros, emit core-only traces; re-check.

## Three Potentially Non-Proveable Items (Watch-List)

1. **Complement-Uniqueness (B1)**  
   May fail without merge commutativity; entire Priority-2 depends on it.

2. **Global Confluence with eqW's Semantic Rule**  
   Canonicalization must ensure joinability; undecidable nf-test inside rule could obstruct proof automation.

3. **Derivability Conditions D1–D3 Inside Terminating TRS**  
   Reflection step tricky; risk of needing an extra "concatenate-proof" operator.

---

## Executable Strategy

1. Implement O-6 kernel in Lean (≈300 loc).
2. Auto-generate critical pairs; let rewrite_search finish confluence proof.
3. Use multiset size to push SN through termination_by.
4. Complete CU; if blocked, switch to non-Priority-2 spec.
5. Mechanise arithmetic & proof checker.
6. Deliver Gödel files; bind Continuous Integration to F1+F2.

This path keeps Priority-1 intact and leaves Priority-2 viable but honestly contingent on B1.

## Forensic Verdict on OperatorMath/O6Final/Kernel.lean

### Immediate Fatal Gaps (Breaks Priority-1 Right Now)

1. **Arithmetic and Equality**  
   "add" / "mul", "structuralEq", "subst", etc. are Lean meta-functions that return Trace terms; they are not expressible as Trace terms built out of {void … eqW}. Arithmetic and equality therefore do NOT "emerge from the single normalization engine".

2. **Dead Code**  
   `recΔ` is never used. The intended internal iterator is dead code; all recursion happens in Lean pattern-matching, outside the calculus.

3. **Reflective Code**  
   `normalize` embeds semantic tests (calls to structuralEq) and nested normalizations. That is reflective code, not a first-order rewrite relation. You still owe:  
   - A rewrite-system description separate from the evaluator.  
   - Proofs of strong normalization + confluence for THAT system.

4. **Complement-Uniqueness Assumption**  
   Complement-uniqueness (Priority-2) is assumed inside normalize—your conditional void-return uses structuralEq. No proof supplied that merges of non-normal forms cannot bypass it or that unique complements exist.

5. **Gödel Claims**  
   No definition of Proof/Prov, no diagonal construction, no D1–D3. Gödel claims still meta-wish.

6. **Capture-Avoidance**  
   "subst" ignores binders because your language has no lam/app in kernel; de-Bruijn comment is aspirational.

7. **Axiom-Free Claim Fails Audit**  
   Lean's pattern-matching compiles to primitive recursors on Trace plus internal equality on Type. That is fine meta-logically, but the statement "all logical connectives are defined operators internal to the trace calculus" is false until you re-express them as Trace terms and verify by normalization alone.

---

## Minimum Fix List

1. Erase structuralEq, add real EqW rule set (Req₁/Req₂) as discussed.
2. Replace normalize with a pure pattern-rewrite relation (inductive Normalises t nf) and prove determinism; implement executable evaluator separately if you want.
3. Define arithmetic, logic, substitution, proof-checker, enumeration, diagonal as closed Trace terms using recΔ + eqW only.
4. Deliver Lean proofs: SN.thm, Confl.thm, ComplementUnique.thm, EqNatComplete.thm, ProofSound.thm, ProvSigma1.thm, Diagonal.thm, G1.thm, G2.thm. All of them must reference only the inductive rewrite relation.
5. Static axiom scan: import list must exclude Init, Classical, Bool, etc. Allow only Lean primitives used to define inductive types and recursive functions that are eliminated afterwards.

---

## Can Priority-2 Survive?

Yes, with O-6 kernel, if you prove ComplementUnique independent of merge-commutativity. Unknown; treat as research task.

---

## Path to Compliance (Compressed)

1. Formalise raw rewrite relation.
2. Prove SN via multiset measure (#β, #ann, δ-height).
3. Enumerate critical pairs, prove local confluence → global via SN.
4. Implement recΔ-based add/mul, encode EqNat, prove completeness.
5. Supply eqW rules, prove plateau lemma for diagonal.
6. Build Proof / Prov, prove Σ₁ bound via recΔ Search.
7. Diagonal-lemma, G₁; internal D1–D3, G₂.
8. Provide Lean extractor that erases every macro, feeds term to stand-alone normaliser; run CI axiom-scan.

---

## Bottom Line

Nice start, but the file is still a meta-level prototype, not the claimed axiom-free calculus. Until every connective, numeral, and theorem is itself a Trace term checked only by the O-6 rewrite system, Priority-1 and Priority-2 remain marketing.
