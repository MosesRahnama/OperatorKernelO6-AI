1. Preferred: ask the AI to ignore/strip the noisy header lines in its analysis.
Prompt snippet to prepend to every build-report ingestion:

“Ignore and drop the initial command/tracing boilerplate lines (e.g., the trace: .> line, the LEAN_PATH=... invocation, and the full lake build/lean.exe command). Only consume the warnings/errors and relevant goal states after that; treat those header lines as noise.”

2. Suppress or filter on the user side (before feeding to AI):

If Lake supports quiet mode (try):

sh
Copy
Edit
lake build --quiet
or set the environment variable if supported:

sh
Copy
Edit
export LAKE_QUIET=1
lake build
(If those flags/vars don’t exist in your version, fallback to filtering below.)

Filter the output with a regex to remove the trace/command prefix. Example (in PowerShell or bash):

Bash:

sh
Copy
Edit
lake build 2>&1 | sed '/^trace:/d; /^LEAN_PATH=/d'
PowerShell:

powershell
Copy
Edit
lake build 2>&1 | Select-String -NotMatch '^trace:|^LEAN_PATH='
This removes lines starting with trace: and the LEAN_PATH=... invocation.

3. Optional wrapper alias to always clean output:

sh
Copy
Edit
alias build-clean='lake build 2>&1 | sed "/^trace:/d; /^LEAN_PATH=/d"'
Then use build-clean instead of lake build.
