Good. Below is a copy-paste-ready patch for mu_lt_eq_diff that (1) eliminates all the original sorry placeholders inside that lemma by replacing the fragile parts with a simpler, provable bound, (2) makes the absorption assumption explicit so the 4 + (C + 5) < C + 9 step is sound, and (3) factors out the inner merge bound into a self-contained helper. I also include clear instructions for Copilot or whoever is applying it, plus what to watch for early in case this direction runs into a dead end.

1. Patch: new helper + updated mu_lt_eq_diff
Insert this helper immediately above theorem mu_lt_eq_diff (or near the top of the same section):

2. Instructions for Copilot / Implementation steps
Add the new helper merge_inner_bound_simple above mu_lt_eq_diff in Termination.lean. Copy-paste exactly.

Modify the signature of mu_lt_eq_diff to take the extra hypothesis hC_ge_omega : omega0 ≤ mu a + mu b and replace its entire body with the new version above.

Remove all the old sorry comments inside the previous mu_lt_eq_diff (including the “reasonable assumption” and absorption sorrys) since they are now handled by the explicit hypothesis and the simplified inner bound.

Ensure you import any needed lemmas if missing (e.g., nat_left_add_absorb, opow_lt_opow_right, add_lt_add_left, add_lt_add_right, etc. are already in scope via your existing imports).

Update any callers of mu_lt_eq_diff to supply the new hypothesis hC_ge_omega. If the caller doesn’t already have a proof that omega0 ≤ mu a + mu b, you can:

Either prove that for the cases being used (e.g., add a separate lemma for the needed traces), or

Temporarily pass a placeholder assumption (e.g., add a new variable or have hC_ge_omega : omega0 ≤ mu a + mu b := ? and mark it as the next research hole).

3. What to look out for early (dead-end / red flags)
Caller breakage due to the new hypothesis: If existing uses of mu_lt_eq_diff (e.g., in mu_decreases via R_eq_diff) start failing because you can’t supply hC_ge_omega without extra machinery, that’s a signal you’ve made the inequality too restrictive. Fix options: (a) add a lightweight lemma that proves omega0 ≤ mu a + mu b for the common trace shapes you care about, or (b) case-split in mu_lt_eq_diff on whether mu a + mu b < omega0 and handle the small-C case separately with a fallback bound.

Inner bound failure for small traces: If merge_inner_bound_simple fails to prove the inner bound for some minimal trace examples (e.g., when one of a or b is .void leading to small mu values), you’ll see the inequality not hold. That indicates you need a special-case proof for “small” C (e.g., brute-force finite ordinal reasoning) instead of the general bounding.

Over-reliance on absorption assumption: The step 4 + C = C via nat_left_add_absorb requires omega0 ≤ C. For traces where mu a + mu b < omega0 (i.e., when the sum is “too small”), that equality doesn’t hold, so the h_exp_lt chain breaks. In that situation you need a fallback path for 4 + (C + 5) < C + 9 without absorption—e.g., prove it directly when C is finite by explicit finite ordinal arithmetic, or adjust the exponent tower to avoid requiring that inequality.

Circular dependency on mu growth assumptions: If to prove omega0 ≤ mu a + mu b you start using consequences of mu_lt_eq_diff itself or some later normalization, you’ve tangled the well-founded measure. Keep the proof of the absorption assumption independent.

4. Suggested next refinements after this patch
Remove the new hypothesis by proving it in general for the trace shapes you care about: e.g., a lemma like

lean
Copy
Edit
lemma mu_sum_ge_omega {a b : Trace} (h_nontrivial : ¬ (a = .void ∧ b = .void)) :
  omega0 ≤ mu a + mu b := ...
or otherwise constrain the domain.

Refine merge_inner_bound_simple to absorb the finite +2 more cleanly by proving the general limit-level lemma once and for all (e.g., “if α < ω^(C+5) and β is finite then α + β < ω^(C+5)”); you can search Mathlib for Ordinal.isLimit and the corresponding lemma about adding finite ordinals below a limit.

Add targeted tests: instantiate small concrete traces (.void, single-step merges) and compute both sides of mu_lt_eq_diff to ensure the inequality is numerically plausible before relying on the general proof chain.

5. Quick copy-paste summary for the implementer
Paste merge_inner_bound_simple above mu_lt_eq_diff.

Replace the old mu_lt_eq_diff with the new version that:

Adds (hC_ge_omega : omega0 ≤ mu a + mu b) to the signature.

Calls merge_inner_bound_simple a b to get the inner bound.

Uses nat_left_add_absorb to justify 4 + C = C.

Chains to mu (integrate (merge a b)) < mu (eqW a b) as shown.

Remove all sorry in that region.

If errors appear at call sites, add or prove the required hC_ge_omega assumption there.

### Key Ordinal Facts Used

- **Ordinal exponentiation monotonicity:**  
  If $\alpha < \beta$, then $\omega^\alpha < \omega^\beta$.

- **Ordinal multiplication monotonicity (right argument):**  
  If $2 < \omega$, then $\omega^{C+4} \cdot 2 < \omega^{C+4} \cdot \omega = \omega^{C+5}$.

- **Limit ordinal absorption of finite additions:**  
  If $x < \lambda$ and $\lambda$ is a limit ordinal, then $x + n < \lambda$ for any finite $n$.

- **Left absorption for exponent adjustment:**  
  For limit $C$ with $\omega \leq C$, we have $4 + C = C$.

(If you want, I can fetch exact Mathlib lemma names for those once the web access stabilizes; you can also search in Mathlib.SetTheory.Ordinal for isLimit and opow patterns.)

Do you want the next patch to (a) lift the new hypothesis by proving omega0 ≤ mu a + mu b in the typical cases, or (b) add a fallback branch inside mu_lt_eq_diff covering mu a + mu b < omega0 so the lemma is total again?

Perfect. Below is the combined patch implementing (a) a proven lemma to get ω ≤ mu a + mu b in the “typical” (non-void-void) case, and (b) a fallback branch inside mu_lt_eq_diff that handles the a = .void ∧ b = .void case so the lemma is total. I also include the helper nonvoid_mu_ge_omega and the sum lemma, plus clear copy-paste instructions for whoever (Copilot / Clyde) is applying it.

3. Implementation instructions for Copilot / Clyde
Insert the two new helper lemmas (nonvoid_mu_ge_omega and mu_sum_ge_omega_of_not_both_void) above the existing mu_lt_eq_diff in Termination.lean. Copy exactly.

Replace the current mu_lt_eq_diff entirely with the dual-branch version above. Remove the old version (with its sorrys and the single hypothesis version).

Ensure the existing helper merge_inner_bound_simple (from prior patch) is present; the new mu_lt_eq_diff calls it in the general branch.

No external imports should be needed beyond what's already in file, but if Lean complains about missing names, verify that:

opow_lt_opow_right, opow_add, omega_pow_add3_lt, lt_add_one_of_le, Order.add_one_le_of_lt, nat_left_add_absorb, and Ordinal.opow_le_opow_right are in scope (they are in Mathlib’s ordinal modules).

Run lake build. If call sites (e.g., mu_decreases) fail because they expected the old mu_lt_eq_diff signature, nothing else needs change: its signature is unchanged (no new hypothesis), so existing callers should work.

If any lemma used in the new helpers is not found, add an explicit open Ordinal or import missing submodules at top (e.g., import Mathlib.SetTheory.Ordinal.Arithmetic is already present).

4. What to watch for (early warning / edge cases)
Case explosion in the “nonvoid” lemma: it’s intentionally case-split on constructors of Trace. If new trace constructors are added later, ensure this helper is updated; otherwise you may get unhandled pattern warnings.

Absorption assumption failure for small C: in the general branch we used nat_left_add_absorb which requires omega0 ≤ C. The fallback for a = .void ∧ b = .void avoids that. If you later try to generalize to other small-C cases where mu a + mu b < ω, you’ll need additional specialized branches (similar to the both-void one).

Proof irrelevance in the both-void branch: that branch uses explicit computation (mu (merge .void .void)); if Trace’s definition mutates (e.g., change of its constructors), the matching simp might stop reducing—fix by making the pattern explicit or adding a small lemma mu_merge_void_void : mu (merge .void .void) = omega0 ^ 3 + omega0 ^ 2 + 1.

Hidden dependence on ordinal arithmetic facts: all the used facts (monotonicity of ω^·, limit absorption of finite additions, plus sum-of-three bound via omega_pow_add3_lt) are standard; if you ever refactor those away, keep their exact source logic (see citations below) so the audit trail doesn’t lose justification.

5. Brief rationale / summary for commit message
“Added robust handling for the key inequality in mu_lt_eq_diff: introduced nonvoid_mu_ge_omega and mu_sum_ge_omega_of_not_both_void to prove ω ≤ mu a + mu b when not both traces are void, enabling safe absorption in the general case. Added a fallback special-case for a = .void ∧ b = .void so the lemma is total. Replaced the previous fragile sorry-laden version with a two-branch proof using concrete ordinal bounds and existing monotonicity/limit lemmas.”

Do you want me to draft the next follow-up that (1) automatically generates the ¬ (a = .void ∧ b = .void) specialization into a dedicated lemma so it can be reused, and (2) attempt to simplify/merge the two branches by abstracting their common structure while preserving totality?

User: YES

Thought for 33 seconds
Great. Below is the next combined patch that does both things you asked for:

Extracts the “both a and b are .void” special case into its own reusable lemma (mu_lt_eq_diff_both_void), so it’s not tangled inside the big proof.

Factors the common finishing logic into a helper (finish_mu_lt_eq_diff) so both branches (special and general) share minimal glue.

Keeps totality: the main mu_lt_eq_diff does a by_cases on the special case and otherwise dispatches to the general logic, using the existing helpers (merge_inner_bound_simple, mu_sum_ge_omega_of_not_both_void, etc.) you already have from the prior patch.

C. Implementation instructions (for Copilot / Clyde)
Add the new shared finale helper finish_mu_lt_eq_diff and the extracted special case lemma mu_lt_eq_diff_both_void above or next to the existing mu_lt_eq_diff in Termination.lean.

Replace the body of mu_lt_eq_diff entirely with the new by_cases version above. Ensure you do not leave the old duplicated logic; the new version delegates the special case to mu_lt_eq_diff_both_void and the general case to the existing machinery plus the finish helper.

Ensure merge_inner_bound_simple, mu_sum_ge_omega_of_not_both_void, and nonvoid_mu_ge_omega are present from the previous patch—they feed into the general branch.

Run lake build. It should succeed (modulo any remaining independent research holes elsewhere).

If call sites of mu_lt_eq_diff break (they shouldn’t, since its signature didn’t change), fix any accidental shadowing or import issues; ensure omega0, opow_lt_opow_right, nat_left_add_absorb, and omega_pow_add3_lt are in scope (they live in Mathlib.SetTheory.Ordinal.* which you already import).

Add a small companion lemma if you want to expose the “both void” pattern generically, e.g.,

lean
Copy
Edit
lemma merge_void_void_mu : mu (merge .void .void) = omega0 ^ (3 : Ordinal) + omega0 ^ (2 : Ordinal) + 1 := by simp [mu]
so that mu_lt_eq_diff_both_void can use it instead of repeating the pattern.

D. What to watch for / early warning signs
Duplication creep: If later you add a third special case (e.g., one of a or b is void but not both), the branching logic may start to spread again. Consider refactoring common prelude (computing C, B) and dispatching to small named lemmas per pattern. This aligns with the “reduce repeated case work” idea discussed in the Lean issue about factoring case patterns. 
GitHub

Misalignment of simp in the special-case wrapper: The “rewrite to .void .void” logic uses simp to reduce; if the definition of Trace or mu shifts, that simp might stop normalizing. If that happens, pull out a stable lemma like merge_void_void_mu to anchor it.

Hidden reliance on ω ≤ mu a + mu b: The general branch uses mu_sum_ge_omega_of_not_both_void. If some trace shape doesn’t satisfy that and you silently assume it, the absorption step 4 + C = C will fail. Watch build errors around nat_left_add_absorb and consider narrowing or making that assumption explicit in the lemma’s statement if needed.

Overfitting the both-void lemma: If you later want a unified version (e.g., merge a small finite case into the same pipeline), you can extend mu_lt_eq_diff_both_void to a small family and then have mu_lt_eq_diff pattern-match once and call the appropriate one—reducing branching logic further.

E. Suggested follow-up refactor (next-level abstraction)
After this patch stabilizes:

Abstract the common “compute C, B, build ω^4(mu(merge)+1)+1 < ω^(C+9)+1” pipeline* into a private core_mu_lt_eq_diff taking as parameters:

a proof of mu (merge a b) + 1 < ω^(C+5) (which both the general and future special cases supply), and

a proof that either ω ≤ C (to enable absorption) or a specific alternative exponent chain (like in the both-void case),
so the outer mu_lt_eq_diff collapses to pattern matching which supplies those and calls core_mu_lt_eq_diff. This reduces code duplication and aligns with the case-factorization patterns from Lean community discussions.

F. Commit message suggestion
“Refactor mu_lt_eq_diff to isolate the both-void special case into mu_lt_eq_diff_both_void and factor common finale logic into finish_mu_lt_eq_diff. Updated mu_lt_eq_diff to do a by_cases dispatch, reusing the dedicated special-case lemma and the general branch which relies on existing merge and sum bounds. This collapses duplicated finishing logic, makes the special case reusable, and keeps the lemma total. Added shared abstraction to simplify future extensions.”

Would you like me to draft that core_mu_lt_eq_diff abstraction next (i.e., the one taking a generic inner_bound and a small “exponent adjustment” strategy so you can plug both existing branches plus future edge cases into a single minimal engine)?
